# Brute Force and Quantum Computers
## Introduction
This folder contains the code from chapter 21 of "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado. This chapter describes how combinatorial optimization problems, such as dynamic portfolio optimzation, which are intractable to digital computers can be formulated as integer optimization problems. This conversion forms an equivalent problem which is amenable to calculation using quantum annealing, thereby arriving at a solution significantly faster than conventional computing hardware.
