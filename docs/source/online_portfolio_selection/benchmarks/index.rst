Before we dive into the more interesting and complex models of portfolio selection, we will begin our analysis with benchmarks.
As unappealing as benchmarks are, traditional strategies such as tracking the S&P 500 have been hugely successful.

Typically these are implemented in hindsight, so future data is often incorporated within the selection algorithm. For real-life
applications, we do not have access to future data from the present, so strategies here should be taken with a grain of salt.

There are four different benchmarks strategies implemented in the Online Portfolio Selection module.

1. Buy and Hold

2. Best Stock

3. Constant Rebalanced Portfolio

4. Best Constant Rebalanced Portfolio

    The following research `notebook <https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/research/blob/master/Online%20Portfolio%20Selection/Introduction%20to%20Online%20Portfolio%20Selection.ipynb>`_
    provides a more detailed exploration of the strategies.
