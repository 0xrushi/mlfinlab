Momentum strategies have been a popular quantitative strategy in recent decades as the simple but powerful trend-following
allows investors to exponentially increase their returns. This module will implement two types of momentum strategy with one
following the best-performing assets in the last period and the other following the Best Constant Rebalanced Portfolio until the last period.

There are three different momentum strategies implemented in the Online Portfolio Selection module.

1. Exponential Gradient

2. Follow the Leader

3. Follow the Regularized Leader
