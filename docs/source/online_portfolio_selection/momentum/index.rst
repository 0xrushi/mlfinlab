.. note::
    The portfolio optimisation module contains different algorithms that are used for asset allocation and optimising strategies. Each
    algorithm is encapsulated in its own class and has a public method called ``allocate()`` which calculates the weight allocations
    on the specific user data. This way, each implementation can be called in the same way and makes it simple for users to use them.
    Next up, lets discuss about some of these implementations and the different parameters they require.

There are four different benchmarks strategies implemented in the Online Portfolio Selection module.

1. Exponential Gradient

2. Follow the Leader

3. Follow the Regularized Leader
