Online Portfolio Selection
==============================

Online Portfolio Selection is an algorithmic trading strategy that sequentially allocates capital among a group of assets to
maximize the final returns of the investment.

Traditional theories for portfolio selection, such as Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory, optimize the balance between the
portfolio's risks and returns. However, OLPS is founded on the capital growth theory, which solely focuses on maximizing the returns
of the current portfolio.

Through these walkthroughs of different portfolio selection strategies, we hope to introduce a set of different selection tools available
for everyone. Most of the works will be based on Dr. Bin Li and Dr. Steven Hoi’s book, Online Portfolio Selection: Principles and Algorithms,
and further recent papers will be implemented to assist the development and understanding of these unique portfolio selection strategies.

There are four different strategies currently implemented in the Online Portfolio Selection module.
